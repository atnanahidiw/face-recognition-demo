## Demo of Face Recognition Inference using Deep Learning

Copied from [ONNX ArcFace Example](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/vision/body_analysis/arcface/dependencies/arcface_inference.ipynb) with a slight adjustment

**Overview**<br>
The demo shows how to use the trained models to do inference in MXNet.

**Models supported**<br>
LResNet100E-IR (ResNet100 backend with ArcFace loss)
